            <h2>Biography: </h2>
            <div>
                <p>Hi i am Nomaan Mansuri. i am a IT( Informetion Tecnology) student. I went to high school in 
                    US for 2 years, oh and I am From India and I moved to US in 2017. Its so amazing being in US.
                    In RVCC this is my 3rd semester. I took web developing as becaue it was required to graduate from RVCC
                    I have interest in IT from the beganning. actuly in india i was majoring on math. to short it down on statistics.
                    It was fun but relly stressfull. because in that class the math problems were like 2 pages long and if you miss a 
                    single number the answer will be different. theirfore i didnt like math that much. I know 5 languages, 1) English,
                    2) Hindi, 3) Urdu, 4) Gujarati, 5) Arebic. Arebic is kind of off and on for me i can read it but i dont know what 
                    i am readding or what does it mean. its kind a lol but yes its me on Arebic. I work 2 jobs right now
                    because of my family. we are new in US and my parents dont know english that well, so i have to contribute 
                    in family. Its not that but now on i dont king staying home and sitting at same place. so doing 
                    2 jobs makes my day go off and help me with staying active. but yes it does interfer in my school schdual
                    but life is a compromise. we need to lose something to gain another.  
                </p>

            <h2>Image hover effects</h2>

            <div>
                <p>Image Hovering effect. also, a piece of art in web design to basically moves the image in a certain way. 
                    Image hovering effect is an effect when you put your cursor onto an image the image takes a different 
                    look other than what it was. it could be by changing its border, or by changing its color, or by changing 
                    its angle, or adding an image description into the image. In this blog we will discuss about the effect I learned 
                    about image hovering effects, and what are some effects I have added to my website. It's not hard but yes 
                    it is a little tricky. I have added the image hovering effect into my hero image on the top of the website.
                    The image of me changing is the border is basically an image hovering effect but it is just a little one. 
                </p>
                <p> You can put image hovering effect on any image by adding these codes. these is a basic code to just begain the hover effect: 
                    <li>img:hover{ 
                    }
                    </li>
                       
                </p>
                <p> After this, you can add anything you like to the image. for example transformation of the image 
                    from left to right. these is called "Flip an Image" you can do that by simply adding this codes to the image: 
                </p>
                    <li> transform: scaleX(-1);</li>
                <p> In the image hovering effect you can also add texts to the image. this can be done either on the top,
                    top right, top left, center, bottom left, or bottom right. when a website user puts his/her mouse on the 
                    image, the image will fade in and display a text of that image.these is called "Image Hover Overlay" The code for these effect and examples can be faund on the W3School website. 
                </p>
                <p> Furthermore, you can add image style of changing the color of the image to look dim, bright, more blues, more redder and blue, etc. This effect is called 
                    "Image Filters" you can add this by simply adding these codes to the IMG hover effect: </p>
                    <li> filter: grayscale(100%);</li>
                    <li>the sizing is your preference.</li>
